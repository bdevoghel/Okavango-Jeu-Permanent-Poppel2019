# Okavango-Jeu-Permanent-Poppel2019
Code developed for the continuous game played at Okavango scouts camp Poppel 2019

Some surprises in the game dyniamics came up during the camp. They lead to some modifications meaning some rules had to be changed. Those changes should have been incorporated in the "RÃ¨gles du jeu".
